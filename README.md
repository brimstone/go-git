go-git
------

This was an experiment to determine the ease of building a static go binary that could checkout a git repo.

It was determined that many different things would need to be compiled statically to pull this off, mainly libzlib, libssl, libssh2, libcurl and finally libgit2.

This project is declared permanently shelved.
